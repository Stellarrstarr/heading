    <h2>
        1) What does semantic HTML mean?
    </h2>
    <p>
        It is also the HTML that introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation.
        A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer (i.e it clearly defines
        its content).<br>
        Examples of semantic elements are form, blockquote, code, em, table and article.
    </p>

        2) Why is it better to put internal styling inside the head instead of the body?
    </h2>
    <p>
        It is better to put internal styling inside the head because when the CSS is declared before the body starts, it
        enables the styles to load faster. This is the reason users see styles like background color before the content
        (in the case of slow network connection).

        <br>
        Also, if the styles are somewhere in the body, the browser has to re-render the page (new and old when loading)
        when the styles declared has been parsed.
        This means that you can use the style tag everywhere you want but the only implications are decreased page
        performance due to possible reflows/repaints once the browser hits styles further down in the page.
        Putting CSS in body means it is being loaded later.
